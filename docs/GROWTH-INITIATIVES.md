Hey Polymarket team!

We built $LIST - a Solana token that burns supply based on your Epstein list market outcomes.

Every time a name confirms YES on your market, we execute an on-chain burn. 8 names confirmed = 25% burned so far.

We're driving traffic to Polymarket and would love to explore a partnership:
- Shoutout from your socials
- Featured in your newsletter
- Co-branded content

We're bringing your prediction markets to the crypto-native audience in a unique way.

Happy to chat more. Here's our site: list-coin.com

- List Drop team

### Value Prop for Polymarket
- Free marketing for their Epstein market
- Novel use case showcasing prediction markets
- Crypto-native audience crossover
