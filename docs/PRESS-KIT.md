## What is $LIST?

$LIST is an event-driven burn token on Solana. Token burns are triggered by real-world events verified through Polymarket prediction markets.

When a name is confirmed on the Epstein list (via Polymarket resolution), a corresponding percentage of $LIST supply is permanently burned on-chain.

**This is not speculation. It's verification.**

---

## How It Works

1. **Polymarket tracks predictions** - "Will [Name] be on the Epstein list?"
2. **Market resolves YES** - Name is publicly confirmed
3. **Burn executes** - Tokens destroyed on-chain, permanently
4. **Supply decreases** - Deflationary by design

All burns are verifiable on Solscan.

## FAQ

**Q: Is this a meme coin?**
A: $LIST has meme appeal but real utility through its burn mechanism. Burns are tied to verifiable real-world events, not hype.

**Q: How do you verify confirmations?**
A: We use Polymarket prediction market resolutions as our oracle. When a market resolves YES, the burn triggers.

**Q: Can the team mint more tokens?**
A: No. There is no mint function. Supply can only decrease.

**Q: What happens after the Epstein list deadline?**
A: The Diddy trial verdict in Q1 2025 is the next major burn event, plus community milestones.

**Q: Is this affiliated with any investigations?**
A: No. $LIST is a community token that tracks public information. We do not have inside information.
